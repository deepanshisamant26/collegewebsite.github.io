        <p>
            A candidate seeking provisional admission/ admission shall be required to fulfill the eligibility criteria of the desired course as decided upon by the University.

            Admission is applicable for those candidates who fulfill all the eligibility norms of the University
            
            If you are a candidate currently in your 12th/ in the last Semester of your graduation, you may proceed for provisional admission. Under the process of Provisional Admission, a candidate may proceed for provisional admission on the basis of his/ her 12th preboard marks/ aggregate of all semesters- this shall be indicative of the marks that may be secured by the candidate in his/ her 12th Examination/ Graduation within a permissible range of 7%.
            
            In case the permissible range is exceeded the candidate shall have to approach the Admission Counselors for the permissible course of action.
            
            There shall be two options of Fee Payment:

The candidate will have to present his/her original documents for verification in a maximum of 10 Days from the date of the Partial Fee Payment, and the Admission will be confirmed only after this entire process. The seat of the applicant will be reserved during the time taken in this entire process. In any disputes arising, the decision of the University Authorities will be considered as final by both parties, since the organization reserves the right of granting or rejecting admission to any candidate.
